Ncview 1.93d  June 13, 2008 -- (C) David W. Pierce
--------------------------------------------------

Overview: What Ncview *is*.
---------------------------
This is the source for "ncview", a X Windows (Release 4 or higher) 
visual browser for netCDF data format files.  Ncview displays a 
2-dimensional, color representation of data in a netCDF file.  You 
can animate the data in time (making simple movies), flip or enlarge 
the picture, scan through various axes, change colormaps, etc.  You
can also plot the data in X-Y plots and then print those, courtesy 
of the SciPlot widget from Robert W. McMullen <rwmcm@orion.ae.utexas.edu>.

What Ncview *isn't*.
--------------------
Ncview is *not* an analysis package.  There are several excellent 
commercial packages available for that.  Rather, its purpose in life 
is to view movies or simple plots of data stored in netCDF format
files quickly, easily, and simply.  To view your data in a 'movie',
all you do is fire Ncview up and press a couple buttons--that's it!  To
make a plot, just click on the movie!  By contrast, analysis programs 
often require a lot of overhead massaging the data before you can do 
much.

I've tested this on DEC 5000s and DEC Alphas, IBM RS/6000s, SGI
workstations, and Linux machines.  It should also work with Suns now.
If you port it to a new platform, please mail me any changes which 
are required!  

Getting ncview

The latest version of Ncview is available for anonymous ftp from

see if I can find binaries for your platform.
