Note:  At the moment this only compiles under the 32 bit ("-32")
compiler.  I hope to fix this in the future.  For now, you need
to have a 32 bit version of the netcdf library to link to if you
want to build from scratch.  Otherwise, you can contact me about
getting a pre-made binary version for IRIX 6.2.
